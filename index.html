            <i>Welcome to Final Fantastic Card!</i>
            <h2 id="gameplay">Gameplay</h2>
            <p>
                At the beginning of the game, each player starts with 7 cards. The aim of the game is to clear all your
                cards before every other player.
            </p>
            <p>
                To view your hand, use the <code>hand</code> command.
            </p>

            <p>
                To play a card, use the <code>play</code> command.
            </p>
            <p>
                More commands can be found in the <a href="#commands">Commands</a> section below.
            </p>

            <h2 id="cards">Cards</h2>
            <p>
                When it is your turn to play a card, you may only play:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Cards of the same color;</li>
                <li>Cards of the same number or symbol;</li>
                <li>Wildcards.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                If you cannot play any of these cards from your hand, you must draw from the deck using the
                <code>draw</code> command.
            </p>
            <h3>Card format</h3>
            <p>
                The first character of the card may be one of <code>R</code>, <code>G</code>, <code>B</code>,
                <code>Y</code> or <code>+</code>. <code>RGBY</code> represent their respective colors (red, green,
                yellow or blue). <code>+</code> indicates a wildcard.
            </p>
            <p>
                If the first character indicates a color, then the second character indicates its face value. It may be
                a number from 0 to 9, <code>S</code> representing <b>skip</b>, <code>R</code> indicating <b>reverse</b>,
                or <code>+</code> indicating <b>draw 2</b>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Otherwise, when the first character is <code>+</code>, the second character indicates whether the card
                is a normal wildcard (<code>+W</code>), or a <b>Wild Draw 4</b> (<code>+4</code>). Additionally, if
                you choose to play one of these cards, you must specify a color with the respective color character,
                such as <code>+4R</code> or <code>+WY</code>
            </p>
            <h3>Card effects</h3>
            <p>
                Color/number cards have no special effect, and play continues as normal. <code>S</code> (skip) cards
                cause the player next in the playing order (see <code>status</code>) to be skipped. <code>R</code>
                (reverse) cause the direction of play to be reversed. In 2 player games, both <code>S</code> and
                <code>R</code> cards have the same effect and repeat your turn. A <code>+</code> card makes the next
                player draw 2 extra cards from the deck, <i>except when the <a href="#cml-draw">cumulative draw</a> 
                house rule is enabled (see below)</i>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Wildcards change the color of play. Indicate the color you want as explained above. Additionally,
                <b>Wild Draw 4</b> cards (<code>+4</code>) make the next player draw 4 extra cards. However, you may
                only play them if you have no other cards to play. The next player may challenge you on this decision.
                If challenged and you did play it legally, they have to draw 6 cards instead. However, if your play was
                illegal, you must draw 4 cards.
            </p>
            <h2 id="commands">Commands</h2>
            <p>
                When you switch games, you must prefix the command with the respective game ID. Otherwise, the bot will
                remember the last game you chose (and will automatically switch you to any newly started game).

            <p>
                In the initial <code>ffc:join</code> command, you may add letters to specify house rules, such as
                <code>ffc:join c</code>:
